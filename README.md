# firestore-auth
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/fatcat2/firestore_auth.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/fatcat2/firestore_auth)

An authentication function with Google Firestore.

I wrote this because I found myself writing just about the same function 18 times. Every time I wrote a Python application with a Firestore backend.

So I just decided to write this module.
